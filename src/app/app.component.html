        <p class="u-large-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-2"> Selling a well-performing asset and buying an investment with lower returns may seem counterintuitive, but the objective of rebalancing is to manage risk rather than maximise return.

          When investors select an asset allocation, they choose a mix of assets that is expected to produce returns that can help them meet their goals with a level of risk they can tolerate.
          
          By periodically rebalancing, investors can diminish the tendency for portfolios to drift to a risk level that is inconsistent with their risk profile.
          
          Rebalancing can also help with discipline and emotional control when markets are volatile.
          
          A set policy will trigger rebalancing events in a consistent manner no matter which direction markets head, which means investors are less likely to make any rash decisions to buy or sell securities that may jeopardise their long-term investment goals.</p>
